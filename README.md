========================

You need two gamepads to run the program, the first one connected adjusts red team values, the second, blue. You can upload a
match list text file, and it will automatically fill in the team numbers with each match number; an example file is attached.

After each match, hit the save button and it will generate a .csv file. Once you've got a collection of matches that you want to
analyze, hit the "Create Master File" button, select the match files, and it will generate a complete file with all the teams and
team scores.

Team values are averages and totals.
